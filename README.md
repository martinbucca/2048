### Overview
This project is a simple 2048 game implemented in Python using the `gamelib` library, which is based on Tkinter. The aim of the game is to reach 2048 by joining the cells that have the same number.  
## Prerequisites
* **Python 3**: Before running this application, please ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest stable version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* **Note**: This application utilizes the [gamelib](https://dessaya.github.io/python-gamelib/) library, which is already included in the code. You don't need to install any external dependencies separately.
## Usage
1. Download the ZIP file or clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell on Windows; Terminal on macOS/Linux).
3. Navigate to the directory where "main.py" is located using the cd command. For example: `cd /path/to/your-repo` (replace "/path/to/your-repo" with the actual path to the directory where "main.py" is located).
4. Run the application using the following command:
   ```sh
   python3 main.py
      ```
